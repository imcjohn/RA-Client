RapidAccess HTML Frontend
-------------------------

This section of the repo stores the html file for the RapidAccess hardware, which is used for updating/configuring settings. I've been developing it in PyCharm along with the rapid-client, hence why it is here rather than with the rest of the hardware stuff. Feel free to take a look, it is a useful example of how to do a simple landing/config page for the esp8266.
